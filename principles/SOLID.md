# SOLID

<i>In software engineering, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make
object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.</i>

by [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

### S - Single-responsibility Principle

<i>Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:</i>

```
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```

### O - Open-closed Principle

<i>Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:</i>

```
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
```

<i>This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.</i>

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle

<i>Liskov Substitution Principle states:</i>

```
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
```

<i>This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent
class.</i>

### I - Interface Segregation Principle

<i>Interface segregation principle states:</i>

```
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
```

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle

<i>Dependency inversion principle states:</i>

```
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
```
