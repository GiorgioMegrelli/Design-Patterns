# OOP

<b><i>Object-oriented programming</i></b>

### Abstraction

<p><i>Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it.</i></p>

<p><i>This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations
relevant for the other objects.</i></p>

<p><i>You interact with your phone by using only a few buttons. What’s going on under the hood? You don’t have to know — implementation details are hidden. You only need to know a short set of actions...</i></p>

<p><i>An object contains some properties and methods. We can hide them from the outer world through access modifiers. We can provide access only for required functions and properties to the other programs.</i></p>

### Encapsulation

<p><i>Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects
don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions —
called methods.</i></p>

<p><i>So, the object manages its own state via methods — and no other class can touch it unless explicitly
allowed. If you want to communicate with the object, you should use the methods provided. But (by
default), you can’t change the state.</i></p>

<p><i>Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class,
preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details
or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.</i></p>

### Inheritance

<p><i>...reuse the common logic and extract the unique logic into a separate class...</i></p>

<p><i>It means that you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. This way, we form a hierarchy.</i></p>

<p><i>The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own (unique part).</i></p>

by [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)

<p><i>Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another
class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the
class that inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class.</i></p>

### Polymorphism

<p><i>...polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there’s no confusion with mixing types. But each child class keeps its own methods as they are.</i></p>

<p><i>This typically happens by defining a (parent) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods.</i></p>

by [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)

<p><i>So polymorphism is the ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).</i></p>
